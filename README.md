You will need to install a few packages for this to work


Download the latest version of python, as of 8/6/2024, that would be Python 3.12.4: Download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

You may copy the following command: `pip install pyautogui pynput Pillow`

Open source code, you are allowed to edit freely and post as your own. If you find issues within the code, feel free to reach out to me on discord: **Steve7108**, repoort it in the issues page, or even better and preferably (if you know python), make a pull request, it helps a ton. Suggestions and feedback is also encouraged through my discord, this is the first version so it may not have many choice but we'll keep working on it.

This project is intended for Valorant, but since it is an external and only really looks for **color**, it can work in any game that has colored outlines for enemies, as the code gets updated, I'll work on a section where you can find every part of the code and what it does.
