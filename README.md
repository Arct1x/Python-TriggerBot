Info:

This is a Triggerbot that uses python 3.X.X and higher, uses 2 python codes as when i tried to combine them, all hell would break loose 24/7. Though in this version I got the delay and Tap Times to work properly, allowing a fully functional code.

HOW TO USE:

Before you start, ensure you have python installed, to install, click (here)[https://www.python.org/downloads/]

1. Open Powershell terminal
2. Run the following commands
```
pip install pyautogui
pip install pynput
pip install numpy
pip install Pillow
```
The rest of the packages come included with your installation of Python 3.X.X, (should, if it dont then you need to either upgrade it or do an entire reinstallation!)

3. Open 3TRY#ddfc.py, this file makes a config.ini file, which contains all your settings and stuff, you can manually adjust it by opening the config file or you can rerun the application.
4. Open 4828x829.py and keep the terminal running, yeahh woo yeah lets go! yeah! it should work, if it dont refer back to step 2.



COMMON TROUBLESHOOTING:

Make sure you have the latest version of pip installed: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip.` (Python 3.x.x only)
If it says you have missing packages, refer back to step 2, or, if it says requirements are satisfied or already met, then follow these steps:

1. Run `pip list`
2. Find all packages within that list that have coorelation with the package that has trouble (You can DM me for help)
3. run `pip uninstall #put packages here` to uninstall any package you put in the hashtag.
4. run `pip cache purge`
5. Go back to step 2 gng lmao

ok thank you it toook me to long to make an ACTUAL working one.
